# Logistic Regression - Breast Cancer Classification

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

Build a binary classifier using logistic regression to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

* **Source:** [Kaggle - Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)
* **Features:** Mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.
* **Target:** Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## ðŸ§ª Steps Performed

1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Preprocessed the data (encoded labels, removed ID column, handled missing values)
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Standardized features using `StandardScaler`
5. Trained a Logistic Regression model
6. Evaluated the model using:

   * Confusion Matrix
   * Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
   * ROC Curve & AUC
7. Visualized the Sigmoid function
8. Tuned classification threshold and re-evaluated performance

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

* Achieved high precision and recall
* ROC-AUC score showed strong model performance

## Submission
Submitted as part of the AI & ML Internship - Task 3.
